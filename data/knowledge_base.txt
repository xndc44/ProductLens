Laptops are versatile computing devices suitable for remote work,
education, and general productivity. When paired with external
keyboards and monitors, they can function as a full workstation.

External monitors improve multitasking and ergonomics by providing
additional screen space and reducing eye strain.

Mechanical keyboards are designed for long typing sessions and
offer better durability and tactile feedback compared to membrane
keyboards.

For home office setups, combining a laptop with an external monitor
and keyboard provides flexibility and ergonomic benefits.

Object recognition from images may not reliably identify brands
or internal specifications. Recommendations should be based on
visible features and common use cases.
